# RAIC-2018
This competition gives you an opportunity to test your programming skills, by creating an artificial intelligence (strategy) controlling a team of robots in a special world (you can learn about details of the CodeBall 2018 world in later sections). In different stages of the contest your team will consist of 2 or 3 robots, and using nitro may or may not be available. All robots have same parameters and are spheres, initial location is guaranteed to be symmetrical. There is also a ball in the game. In each game you are to compete against another player’s strategy. You team’s goal — is to score the ball into opponent’s net and defend your own. Team who has scored most goals is the winner. Game can also be tied if both teams scored same number of goals.
2 rounds and final  took me 4 weeks and about 95 hours.
